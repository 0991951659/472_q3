# Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Artists Analysis

This repository contains the code, report and data for an analysis of the enduring popularity of the Rolling Stone 100 greatest artists.

The official report and code can be accessed in the markdown and html file "472_q3".

Sean Miller created the Billboard dataset which he kindly makes available for public access. The data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/HipsterVizNinja/random-data/tree/main/Music/hot-100)

Additionally, I attach the csv files of the two datasets I used for the final analysis. To replicate exact graphs, these csv files should be used as the 100 Billboard artists are randomly selected and may lead to different visualisation.
